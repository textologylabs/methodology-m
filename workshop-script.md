## Workspace Convention

The `workshop/workspace/` folder holds generated artefacts produced during the workshop. These are outputs of M Power actions — not source material.

```
workshop/
  jira/               ← source story files (hand-authored)
  workspace/
    jira/             ← generated: enriched stories, sub-tasks, PATs (staging)
```

In the real M Power flow, there is no staging area — everything goes directly into the root repo.

---

## Step 1: Create Project Workspace ✅

🦊 Create top-level group `methodology-m` manually (SaaS restriction).

💬 `Set up the todo-m-workshop subgroup under methodology-m using M Power.`

👻 Invokes `m-power setup-workspace`. Creates the GitLab subgroup via GitLab MCP.

👀 Group visible at `https://gitlab.com/groups/methodology-m/todo-m-workshop`

---

## Step 2: Bootstrap Root Repo ✅ (seeding) / ⏳ (PATs)

💬 `Bootstrap the root repo using M Power. Use the story file at workshop/jira/TODOM-000.md.`

👻 Invokes `m-power bootstrap-root-repo`:
1. Extracts project metadata from Story Zero's `## Project` section
2. Creates `todo-m-root` repo in `methodology-m/todo-m-workshop` via `gitlab-ops create_project` (requires `namespace_id` — the standard GitLab MCP `create_repository` cannot target groups)
3. Pushes seed commit: `project.yaml` (all versions at v0.0.0), `jira/TODOM-000.md`, folder structure (`pats/`, `stories/`, `packages/shell/`, `.kiro/`), and `README.md`
4. Asks: "Root repo seeded. Want me to generate PATs now?"

💬 `Yes`

👻 Delegates to `m-power generate-pats`:
5. Generates story-level PATs from acceptance criteria
6. Presents PAT draft for review

💬 Reviews PAT draft, confirms or requests changes.

👻 Commits `pats/TODOM-000.pat.yaml` to the root repo.

🦊 Show the audience the root repo — file structure, project.yaml, story, PATs.

👀 `todo-m-root` exists on GitLab with `project.yaml`, `jira/TODOM-000.md`, `pats/TODOM-000.pat.yaml`, folder structure.

---

## Step 3: Decompose Story ⏳

💬 `Decompose TODOM-000 into sub-tasks using M Power.`

👻 Invokes `m-power decompose-story`:
1. Reads story and PATs from the root repo
2. Proposes PAT-to-component mapping

💬 Reviews mapping, confirms or adjusts.

👻 Generates and commits sub-task files (TODOM-000a through TODOM-000d).

👀 Root repo now contains `jira/TODOM-000a.md` through `jira/TODOM-000d.md` plus enriched story.

---

## Step 4: Scaffold Managed Repos ⏳

💬 `Scaffold the managed repos for TODOM-000.`

👻 Invokes `m-power scaffold-repo` for each sub-task:
1. Creates `todo-m-mfe`, `todo-m-api-read`, `todo-m-api-write` on GitLab
2. Seeds each with README, CI stub, repo-level PAT stubs
3. Updates `project.yaml` with repo locations

🦊 Show the audience the GitLab group — all repos visible. Walk through one managed repo.

👀 All repos exist. Topology complete. Scaffolding only — no implementation yet.

---

## Design Decisions

### Bootstrap Sequencing

**Context:** PATs need to live in the root repo (`pats/`), but the root repo doesn't exist until bootstrap creates it.

**Resolution:** Bootstrap is a sequence of atomic capabilities:

1. `setup-workspace` — creates the GitLab group
2. `bootstrap-root-repo` — creates root repo, seeds with `project.yaml` and Story Zero
3. `generate-pats` — generates PATs, commits to root repo (delegated, not reimplemented)
4. `decompose-story` — decomposes into sub-tasks, creates managed repos

The root repo becomes the source of truth the moment it's created. Each capability stays atomic with user decision points between steps.
